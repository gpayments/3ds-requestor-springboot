/**
 * GPayments 3DS Server API Reference
 * Welcome to the 3DS Server RESTful API. You can use our API to access 3DS Server functionalities.  The 3DS Server API is organised around REST. Our API has predictable, resource-oriented URLs, and uses HTTP response codes to indicate API errors. We use built-in HTTP features, such as HTTP authentication and HTTP verbs, which are understood by off-the-shelf HTTP clients. We support cross-origin resource sharing, allowing you to interact securely with our API from a dto-side web application (though you should never expose your secret API key in any public websiteâ€™s dto-side code). JSON is returned by all API responses, including errors.
